#+TITLE: Lunaryline


This is a fast and minimum alternative to beautiful but slow spaceline.
Like spaceline, lunaryline is based on powerline.
Unlike spaceline, there is no customization functionality.
In another word, lunaryline is a powerline theme that looks like spaceline.

* To use lunaryline

*Note:* lunaryline is not in melpa.

Install powerline and put lunaryline.el in your load-path.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'lunaryline)
(lunaryline-default-theme)
#+END_SRC

If you want to use =use-package=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(use-package powerline
  :config 
  (require 'lunaryline)
  (lunaryline-default-theme))
#+END_SRC

Byte compile lunaryline.el can speed up things a bit:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(lunaryline-compile)
#+END_SRC
